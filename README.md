1. Attempt a new LeetCode problem that is slightly more challenging than your current skill level.
2. If you get stuck, do not look at hints, categories, or solutions. Instead, identify specific areas where you need further study, focus on those, then return to the problem and try solving it again.
3. If youâ€™re still unsure how to progress, skip the problem and revisit it after more practice.
4. If you solve the problem, review the top solutions. Reflect on how others approached the problem and think about ways to incorporate their methods into your problem-solving approach to achieve similar results in the future.
