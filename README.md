# General learning priciples
1. Challenge Yourself: Attempt a new LeetCode problem that’s slightly above your current skill level.
2. Avoid Premature Hints: If you get stuck, resist checking hints, categories, or solutions. Instead, pinpoint the specific areas you need to study further. Focus on these, then return to the problem and try solving it again.
3. Use Similar Questions: If you’re still unsure, toggle 'Similar Questions' and try solving those first to build confidence and insight.
4. Consider Hints and Categories: Only after struggling with similar questions, review hints and categories for guidance.
5. Consult Solutions Sparingly: If all else fails and you’ve spent more than an hour on the problem, look at solutions to capture the intuition you’re missing. Then, try solving the problem independently without revisiting the solutions.
6. Reflect on Top Solutions: Once you solve the problem, review the top solutions. Analyze how others approached it, and think about ways to incorporate their techniques into your problem-solving strategy for similar challenges in the future.
