# General learning priciples
1. Challenge Yourself: Attempt a new LeetCode problem that’s slightly above your current skill level.
2. Avoid Premature Hints: If you get stuck, resist checking hints, categories, or solutions. Instead, pinpoint
3. If you still cannot figure out what to do, skip the question and return to it in future again.
4. Reflect on Top Solutions: Once you solve the problem, first think about more effecient approahces and then review the top solutions. Analyze how others approached it, and think about ways to incorporate their techniques into your problem-solving strategy for similar challenges in the future.

If you return to the question multiple times without being able to solve it:
1. Use Similar Questions: If you’re still unsure, toggle 'Similar Questions' and try solving those first to build confidence and insight.
4. Consider Hints and Categories: Only after struggling with similar questions, review hints and categories for guidance.
5. Consult Solutions Sparingly: If all else fails and you’ve spent more than an hour on the problem, look at solutions to capture the intuition you’re missing. Then, try solving the problem independently without revisiting the solutions.
